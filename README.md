## General Information
- Background
    The Lending Club Case Study analyzes loan data to assess risks and opportunities in the peer-to-peer lending industry. 
    This study is intended to provide actionable insights into borrower behavior and help improve financial decision-making processes.
- Business Problem
    Identifying key factors influencing loan defaults.
    Providing a data-driven approach to mitigate risks for lenders.
    Enhancing the understanding of borrower profiles to predict repayment likelihood.
- Dataset
    The analysis uses the Lending Club loan dataset, which includes attributes such as loan amount, interest rate, 
    grade, employment length, annual income, and loan status. The dataset contains historical records of borrowers and their repayment patterns.

## Technologies Used
- EDA techniques
- Python (Version 3.x): Programming and data analysis.
- Pandas (Version 1.4.0): Data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy (Version 1.22.0): Numerical computations.
- Matplotlib (Version 3.5.0) and Seaborn (Version 0.11.2): Data visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for running the analysis.

## Conclusions
- Grade A and B borrowers should be prioritized for lending due to their lower default risks.
- Secondary focus can be given to Grades C and D, but with caution.
- Majority of the customers fall under the annual income bracket of 40k - 50k.
- Low-income borrowers should avoid loans for high-risk purposes such as home improvement, renewable energy, small business ventures, or weddings, as these can cause financial strain.
- Loans with shorter terms (36 months) are preferable for low-income borrowers, as they facilitate faster repayment and reduce exposure to default risks.
